        <p>
            I love playing and listening to music. I play the tenor saxophone
            in Corban's band and have played in jazz band at my community college
            at home in the Tri Cities. I've played the saxophone for 8 years now,
            I started with alto and switched over to the tenor about 4 years ago.
            I also played the piano when I was younger and now wish I hadn't stopped
            playing, maybe I will try to relearn it soon when I get a chance to. 
            I also tried my hand at music production once or twice and own a DAW,
            but I quickly realized I didn't know enough music theory to write music
            that I would want to listen to. I'm taking music theory classes this year
            though so maybe I will try it out again!
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt><b> DAW </b></dt>
                <dd>
                    This stands for digital audio workstation, it is a
                    powerful tool used to produce music.
                </dd>
            <dt><b> Music Theory </b></dt>
                <dd>
                    All the complicated ways to write and interpret music
                    that I don't know a lot about either, but I get to learn them :&#41
                </dd>
            <dt><b> Key </b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A key determine the notes a song uses. Different keys make
                    music sound different, and variations in songs sometimes 
                    come from changing the key in the middle. This is one of the 
                    things I want to learn more about in theory.
                </dd>
            <dt><b> Chord </b></dt>
                <dd>
                    Another thing I want to learn more about, these are constructed
                    with multiple specific notes to make a new sound. There are normally chords
                    heard in the background of music we listen to and help the rest of
                    the song sound better and highlight the melody of the music.
                </dd>
            <dt><b> Melody </b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The part of the song you would most often hum. This is the main 
                    part of the song that is brought out, and if there are lyrics to
                    a song the person singing is most likely singing the melody.
                </dd>
